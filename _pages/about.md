I'm a software engineer on the [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) team at Microsoft. In addition to PowerShell itself, I work on the [Visual Studio Code extension for PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell), work on the [PowerShell subkernel for .NET Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive), helped ship the PowerShell experience in Azure Functions v2+, and more! I also [live stream coding](https://TylerLeonhardt.live) at work. I'm a developer experience nut, love coffee and love to customize mechanical keyboards.

I use C#, TypeScript, and of course, PowerShell, every day.

See what I'm up to both at work and off work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/TylerLeonhardt) üêôüêà
